# Overview

Within this document, we highlight the different features of the `simcdm` package
as it relates to simulating cognitive diagnostic modeling data. 

## Notation

For consistency, we aim to use the following notation.

Denoting individuals:

- $N$ is the total number of individuals taking the assessment.
- $i$ is the current individual.

Denoting items:

- $J$ is the total number of items on the assessment.
- $j$ is the current item
- $Y_{ij}$ is the observed binary response for individual $i$ ($1\leq i \leq N$) to item $j$ ($1\leq j\leq J$).
- $s_j$ is the probability of slipping on item $j$. 
- $g_j$ is the probability of guessing on item $j$.

Denoting attributes:

- $K$ is the total number of attributes for the assessment item.
- $k$ is the current attribute.
- $\boldsymbol\alpha_i=\left(\alpha_{i1},\dots,\alpha_{iK}\right)^\prime$ 
  where $\boldsymbol\alpha_i\in \left\{0,1\right\}^K$ and $\alpha_{ik}$ is 
  the latent binary attribute for individual $i$ on attribute $k$ ($1\leq k\leq K$).

Denoting the skill/attribute "Q" matrix: 

- $\boldsymbol q_{j}=\left(q_{j1},\dots,q_{jK}\right)^\prime$ be the
  $j$th row of $\boldsymbol Q$ such that $q_{jk}=1$ if 
  attribute $k$ is required for item $j$ and zero otherwise.

# Usage

To use `simcdm`, please load the package.

```{r}
library(simcdm)
```

## Matrix Simulation

Simulations within this section are done underneath the following settings.

```{r}
# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(888)

# Setup Parameters
N = 15   # Number of Examinees / Subjects
J = 10   # Number of Items
K = 2    # Number of Skills / Attributes
```

### Identifiable Q Matrix Simulation

Simulate an identifiable $Q$ matrix  ($J$ items by $K$ skills).

```{r}
Q = sim_q_matrix(J, K)
Q
```

### $\eta$ Matrix Simulation

Create the ideal response matrix for each trait ($J$ items by $2^K$ latent classes).

```{r}
eta = sim_eta_matrix(K, J, Q)
eta
```

### Attribute profile simulation

Generate latent attribute profile classes ($2^K$ latent classes by $K$ skills).

```{r}
class_alphas = sim_attribute_classes(K)
class_alphas
```

Generate latent attribute profile class for each subject ($N$ subjects by $K$ skills).

```{r}
subject_alphas = sim_subject_attributes(N, K)
subject_alphas

# Equivalent to:
# subject_alphas = class_alphas[sample(2 ^ K, N, replace = TRUE),]
```

### DINA Simulation

Simulations within this section are done underneath the following settings.

```{r}
# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(888)

# Setup Parameters
N = 15   # Number of Examinees / Subjects
J = 10   # Number of Items
K = 2    # Number of Skills / Attributes

# Assign slipping and guessing values for each item
ss = gs = rep(.2, J)

# Simulate identifiable Q matrix
Q = sim_q_matrix(J, K)

# Simulate subject attributes
subject_alphas = sim_subject_attributes(N, K)
```

### DINA Item Simulation

Simulate item data, $Y$, under DINA model ($N$ by $J$)

```{r}
items_dina = sim_dina_items(subject_alphas, Q, ss, gs)
items_dina
```

### DINA Attribute Simulation

Simulate attribute data under DINA model ($N$ by $J$)

```{r}
attributes = sim_dina_attributes(subject_alphas, Q)
attributes
```

## rRUM Simulation

The rRUM simulations are done using the following settings.

```{r}
# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(888)

# Setup Parameters
N = 15   # Number of Examinees / Subjects
J = 10   # Number of Items
K = 2    # Number of Skills / Attributes

# The probabilities of answering each item correctly for individuals 
# who do not lack any required attribute
pistar = rep(.9, J)

# Penalties for failing to have each of the required attributes
rstar  = .5 * Q

# Latent Class Probabilities
pis = c(.1, .2, .3, .4)

# Generate latent attribute profile with custom probability (N subjects by K skills)
subject_alphas = sim_subject_attributes(N, K, prob = pis)

# Equivalent to:
# class_alphas = sim_attribute_classes(K)
# subject_alphas = class_alphas[sample(2 ^ K, N, replace = TRUE, prob = pis),]
```

### Simulate rRUM items

Simulate rRUM item data $Y$ ($N$ by $J$)

```{r}
rrum_items = sim_rrum_items(Q, rstar, pistar, subject_alphas)
rrum_items
```
